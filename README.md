# My Study Club

## Project Aims
The aim was to develop a online flashcard application in which users could create and learn from digital flashcards. The app has the following functionality:
- create / join a study club
    - a passcode can be shared for peers to join
- create / edit / view / test flashcards that belong to the club
    - create flashcards using voice recognition
    - play a matching memory game with the flashcards in the test page
